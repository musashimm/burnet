*BURNET - _BU_ild_R_ootformm_NET_1002*

h1. Introduction

If you work with embedded Linux you can choose to approaches to take:

 * use some Linux distribution
 * use _Buildroot_ and build Your own system form scratch

I took second way. It has no limitation in my opinion but for example you must build almost all software packages not included in _Buildroot_ package by yourself. Second way gives you also possibility to use of newest software packages and drivers than in any distribution.

h1. Hardware

Hardware I use is MMNet1002 board developed by Propox. You can get much details form "Propox web page":http://www.propox.com/products/t_232.html .

h1. Software versions

Currently following versions of buildroot are supported:

* 2011.02
* 2010.11

h1. Usage of package

# Unpack _Buildroot_ package to *BUILDROOT_DIR*
# Unpack _Burnet_ package to *BURNET_DIR*
# Go to *BURNET_DIR* and use merge.sh script to merge both packages. (without parameters merge.sh script shows how to use it).
# Go to *BUILDROOT_DIR*
# Type _make_ (to_build)

After build in _*BUILDROOT_DIR*/output/images/_ you have images to flash memory:
* uImage - kernel image,
* rootfs.ext - rootfs image, you can mount it in local system to check that everything is inside,
* rootfs.ubifs - rootfs image to flash NAND,
* rootfs.ubi - ubi volume to flash NAND.

h1. Customization

If you want to change something in configuration, _Buildroot_ package makes available some useful configuration commands:

* _make menuconfig_ - configuration of _Buildroot_
* _make busybox-menuconfig_ - configuration of _Busybox_
* _make uclibc-menuconfig_ - configuration of _uClibc_
* _make linux26-menuconfig_ - configuration of linux kernel

*NOTE!* After configuration, copy .config file to _*BURNET_DIR*/Propox/MMNet1002/configs/_ directory with proper name.

If above configuration doesn't suit you, you can do some customization using _*BURNET_DIR*/Propox/MMNet1002/prepare_custom_config.sh_

h1. Support of onboard hardware

 * debug console on ttyS0 (DSUB)
 * ethernet (RJ45)
 * USB
 ** host (built-in)
 ** storage class (module)
 ** UVC - usb video class (module)
 * I2C - (module)
