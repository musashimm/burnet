h1. Introduction

If you work with embedded Linux you can choose to approaches to use:

 * use some Linux distribution 
 * use _Buildroot_ and build Your own system form scratch

I took second way. It has no limitation in my opinion but for example you must build almost all software packages not included in _Buildroot_ package by yourself. Second way gives you also possibility to use of newest software packages and drivers than in any distribution.
