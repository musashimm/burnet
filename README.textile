BURNET - _BU_ild_R_ootformm_NET_1002

h1. Introduction

If you work with embedded Linux you can choose to approaches to take:

 * use some Linux distribution
 * use _Buildroot_ and build Your own system form scratch

I took second way. It has no limitation in my opinion but for example you must build almost all software packages not included in _Buildroot_ package by yourself. Second way gives you also possibility to use of newest software packages and drivers than in any distribution.

h1. Hardware

Hardware I use is MMNet1002 board developed by Propox. You can get much details form "Propox web page":http://www.propox.com/products/t_232.html

h1. Software versions

 * Buildroot - 2010.11
 * BusyBox - 1.17
 * Linux Kernel - 2.6.36
 * uClibc - 0.9.31

h1. Usage of package

# Install _Buildroot_ package to *BUILDROOT_DIR*
# Install _Burnet_ package to *BURNET_DIR*
# Change directory to *BUILDROOT_DIR8
# Type _make_ (choose for Target Architecture -> _arm_, for Target Architecture Variant -> _arm926t_, for Kernel choose newest one) then choose _Exit_ and save .config file
# Type _make_ once again (it builds toolchain)
# Make symbolic link ln -s *BURNET_DIR*/Propox *BUILDROOT_DIR*/target/device
# Modify *BUILDROOT_DIR*/target/device/Config.in file: add _source "target/device/Propox/Config.in"_ after all sources entries.
# Ad symbolic link _ln -s *BURNET_DIR*/Propox/MMNet1002/configs/buildroot.config *BUILDROOT_DIR*/configs/ MMNet1002_defconfig_
# Type _make MMNet1002_defconfig_ in *BUILDROOT_DIR* to
# Type _make_ to build all stuff.

h1. Customization

If you want to chanage something in configuration _Buildroot_ package makes available some useful configuration commands:

* _make menuconfig_ - configuration of _Buildroot_
* _make busybox-menuconfig - configuration of _Busybox_
* _make uclibc-menuconfig - configuration of _uClibc_
* _make linux26-menuconfig - configuration of linux kernel

NOTE! After configuration, copy .config files to *BURNET_DIR*/Propox/MMNet1002/configs/directory.

If above configuration don't suit you can do some customization using *BURNET_DIR*/Propox/MMNet1002/prepare_custom_config.sh

h1. Support of on board hardware

 * debug console on ttyS0 (DSUB)
 * ethernet (RJ45)
 * USB
 ** host (built-in)
 ** storage class (module)
 ** UVC - usb video class (module)
 * I2C - (module)
