h1. Introduction

If you work with embedded Linux you can choose to approaches to use:

 * use some Linux distribution 
 * use _Buildroot_ and build Your own system form scratch

I took second way. It has no limitation in my opinion but for example you must build all software packeges by yourself. Second way gives you also possibility to use of newest software packeges and drivers than in any distribiution.
